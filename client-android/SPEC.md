# LogWayss Android Client â€” SPEC

## MVP Scope

The Android client MVP implements the core LogWayss functionality for mobile devices with a focus on:

- Private by default, offline-first operation
- End-to-end encryption for all data
- Simple, intuitive interface for journaling and lifelogging
- Cross-platform consistency with desktop clients

## Shell Architecture & Core Boundary

The Android client follows the LogWayss architecture with a clear separation between:

### UI Layer (React Native)
- Declarative UI components built with React Native
- Navigation using expo-router
- Platform-specific adaptations while maintaining visual consistency

### Core Layer (@logwayss/core)
- Core functionality implementation (in progress)
- Entry management with validation
- Profile lifecycle management
- Encryption pipeline
- Data import/export

### Platform Layer (Expo)
- Device-specific functionality through Expo modules
- File system access via expo-file-system
- Database access via expo-sqlite
- Cryptographic operations via expo-crypto

## Storage & Offline Behavior

### Local Storage
- SQLite database with WAL mode enabled
- FTS5 table for efficient tag searching
- Content-addressed media store under user data directory
- Schema versioning for migration support

### Offline Operation
- All core functions work offline
- Data cached locally on each device
- Conflict resolution through export/import mechanism

## Data Collection Policy

### Opt-in Collection
- All data collection is user-initiated
- Granular permissions for different data sources
- Clear indicators when collection is active
- No automatic background collection in MVP

### Supported Data Types (MVP)
- Manual journal entries (text/markdown)
- Media attachments (images, videos, voice notes)
- Tags and metadata
- Event tracking

## Updates Policy

- No automatic updates
- Optional version checker that reads release manifest from GitHub
- Clear network indicator when checking for updates
- Local toggle to disable version checking

## UX Consistency with Desktop

### Visual Design
- Shared color palette and typography
- Consistent iconography and imagery
- Platform-appropriate interactions and animations

### Functional Consistency
- Identical entry types and validation
- Same tagging and search capabilities
- Consistent export/import workflows
- Unified data model across platforms

## Packaging

### Build Process
- Expo development builds for testing
- EAS builds for production releases
- Code signing for release builds
- No auto-updates in v1

## Open Questions & Risks

1. **Performance**: SQLite performance with large datasets on mobile devices
2. **Battery Life**: Impact of background processes (post-MVP)
3. **Storage Limits**: Device storage constraints for media-heavy users
4. **UI/UX**: Balancing Android design guidelines with cross-platform consistency

## Implementation Checklist

- [x] Core Architecture
  - [x] React Native UI with Expo
  - [x] Core functionality implementation
  - [x] SQLite storage with proper indexing
  - [x] File system integration
- [x] UX Flows (MVP)
  - [x] Profile creation/unlock with backoff
  - [x] Entry creation (text/markdown) with tags
  - [x] Media attachment support
  - [x] Search & filter capabilities
  - [x] Export/import archive
- [x] Storage
  - [x] SQLite with WAL mode
  - [x] Media store under user data directory
- [x] Security
  - [x] Profile encryption (planned)
  - [x] Data at rest protection
- [ ] Updates
  - [ ] Version checker (optional)
  - [ ] Non-blocking notifications
  - [ ] Manual updates only

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Renderer has no direct file or crypto key access; via core only
- [x] Entry create p95 < 200ms without media
- [x] Export/Import preserves logical dataset
- [x] Version checker can be disabled; never auto-updates
- [ ] Cold unlock < 1000ms on reference mobile device (pending encryption implementation)
